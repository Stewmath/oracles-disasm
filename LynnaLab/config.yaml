# Normally each tileset has "Main Gfx", "Unique Gfx", "Palette", and "Tilemap" variables. These all
# mix together to define how the tileset looks.  This adds a confusing layer of indirection when
# editing tilesets. So, on certain oracles-disasm branches, all of that complexity has been removed,
# and each tileset simply has its own data for all of this. This uses more space in the rom.
#
# Don't modify this. The relevant branches (ie. hack-base) have it set if necessary.
